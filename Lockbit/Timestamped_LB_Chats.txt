[] 

[2025-01-17 19:36:56] yes.
so what is the problem?

[2025-01-17 19:37:12] Who are we talking to? User or Admin?

[2025-01-17 19:39:43] i am from the staff. i am one of the computer study teachers, helping to manage our data. i know a bit if you send me an instruction i think i can fix our computers again


[2025-01-17 19:40:07] What institution do you belong to? topackt?

[2025-01-17 19:42:16] as far i know they manage a part of our network. but i am part of the a school



[2025-01-17 19:42:32] which one

[2025-01-17 19:45:16] entire topackt network has been attacked. its their fault for unsecure systems.
we are here to help resolve this for the better of both sides.

[2025-01-17 19:47:19] Sorry got disconnected again
thats our address and name

UniversitÃ¤t Mannheim
68131 Mannheim


[2025-01-17 19:51:14] You are using dnsx.topackt.net as domain?

[2025-01-17 19:51:43] For Active Directory?

[2025-01-17 19:53:32] can you tell which SERVERxx your network is using?

[2025-01-17 19:59:12] i asked colleges we are not sure about the serverXX details. i think that is managed by our external domain manager. dns is correct



[2025-01-17 20:00:07] how many servers/machines are affected from you?

[2025-01-17 20:04:39] We will offer decryption and deletion of all data from entire topackt network for 110k$ in btc or 90k$ in xmr.

[2025-01-17 20:05:26] i dont need topackt stuff just our school  please its about 20 computers


[2025-01-17 20:06:52] at least where we found corrupted files.


[2025-01-17 20:11:33] and i checked thats not possible to pay for us we are just a small school its about 21109767 US Dollars

[2025-01-17 20:20:21] you misunderstood.
110 000 US Dollars in Bitcoin or 90 000 US Dollars in Monero

[2025-01-17 20:20:49] unfortunately we can't offer you decryptor for single institution. decryptor is for entire topackt system. we can't guarantee you are not giving it away for lower price you should probably contact topackt and demand resolution with us.

[2025-01-17 20:21:37] that is low price in comparison to network size and data stolen

[2025-01-17 20:21:55] if you have any more questions please let us know

[2025-01-17 20:25:04] we are sorry that we cant help you

[2025-01-17 20:31:23] could take until monday i cant reach them now its weekend

[] 

[2025-01-17 20:38:44] Please I need to solve it for less than, $30,000?

[2025-01-17 20:40:13] No

[2025-01-17 20:40:17] The price is 50,000 dollars.

[2025-01-24 16:37:51] hi

[] 2025-01-24 16:38:46

[2025-01-24 16:38:48] The previous public chat has been blocked. Now we can communicate with you privately.

[2025-01-24 16:39:42] We know about the TOX conversation and that you have already agreed to a price of $50,000.

When will you be ready to pay? How much time do you need?

[2025-01-24 16:41:17] 50,000 is really difficult for me. What is the lowest price you can give me?

[2025-01-24 16:45:03] So in the last chat you agreed to the amount of 40,000 dollars.

We do not agree with this price.
But we agree to give you a discount of 5,000 dollars, and the final price will be 45,000 dollars, but on one condition: that you make the payment within 24 hours.
Do you agree?

[] NULL

[2025-01-24 17:01:20] We offer you the following options:

Main Option:
The main payment is due on Tuesday. Find an additional $5,000 to bring the total payment to $45,000.

We are willing to offer you an alternate option:
If you make a $5,000 deposit today, we will give you a $5,000 discount and you can pay the balance of $35,000 on Monday or Tuesday.

Which option do you choose?

[2025-01-24 17:13:10] Ok I would accept the second option. Today I could transfer the 5000, I need the instructions. On the other hand, I would appreciate it if you could send me some other file, of your choice, so that I know that I am not spending the money uselessly.

[] 

[2025-01-24 17:24:17] We always focus on the time zone UTC+0, so you have approximately 6.5 hours.

[2025-01-24 17:33:02] Perfect. I'm getting everything ready. I'm waiting for the address.

[2025-01-24 17:55:12] This is bitcoin wallet address for payment:
bc1q6tqarpua79kwqr0u6np9ac4faqv5hz96rhl92v

[2025-01-24 17:56:15] We are currently preparing a partial file tree for you. This will take some time.

[2025-01-24 18:41:30] Good

[2025-01-24 19:17:23] 

[2025-01-24 19:17:45] Please select a file and we will send you the original file.

[2025-01-24 19:30:44] .\Datos\MCasella\PC\NICATEL\EMPLEADOS\SUELDOS\PLANILLA ARCHIVO SANTANDER\11.2024\Planilla adelantos Santander 11.2024.txt

[2025-01-24 19:32:03] Please, could you also confirm that you have the original .mfd files and show me their names?

[2025-01-24 20:19:13] 

[2025-01-24 20:20:20] Perhaps you are not talking about "mfd" files, but about "mdf" database files?

[2025-01-24 20:24:32] All the files we downloaded from you are in perfect order, and they are whole and functioning.
We sent you a list of files, a partial file tree, which contains about 5% of all the files we downloaded. The full file tree + full logs of deleting these files from our servers you can get only after payment.

[2025-01-24 20:46:57] Yes, sorry I mean MDF

[2025-01-24 20:52:32] I see that these files are not in the partial file tree. They may be in the general list, but you will be able to see it only after payment. In any case, if these files are there, they are in perfect order. But you should not worry about this, because after payment you will also receive the decryption keys for the files, and you will be able to decrypt your files if they are encrypted and do not function for now.

When will you make the payment? We have fulfilled the conditions on our side. You have about 3 hours left.

[2025-01-24 20:55:42] Well, we trust you.
Payment will be made today. We are working on it.

[2025-01-24 21:45:43] Ok, we are waiting.

[] 2025-01-24 21:50:54

[2025-01-24 22:08:59] ok

[2025-01-24 22:45:13] Done

[2025-01-24 22:46:24] you need the id?

[2025-01-24 23:00:37] Everything is fine. We have received your advance payment. We will wait for the rest of the money from you, Monday or Tuesday. $35,000.

[2025-01-24 23:01:22] thanks

[2025-02-11 15:34:41] Dear Lockbit, may we state that last year was the only time we were profitable and we only earned $200k.  We have also notified the regulators and our clients as well as required by law since the encryption last January 25 caused a major outage.   That said, we were able to restore operation with some backups, albeit with some data loss therefore decryption wont really be necessary.  Please give as an amount that we can get back to our leaders to be considered.


[2025-02-11 15:51:36] maybe we can lower the amount, but not by much.

[2025-02-11 15:54:01] in the process of working with you, we thought about 100k.

[2025-02-11 16:04:05] our principles have become worth more than money. However, a discount can be negotiated.

[2025-02-11 16:06:15] Thank you for your consideration. 100k is still very steep for us as its half of our revenue which will be negated with the damage caused by the outage.  May we respectfully ask to please significantly bring it down since we are only technically be requesting for the deletion of the data and we do understand that this is just business for you.

[2025-02-11 16:28:29] If I give a price now, it will be the last one.

[2025-02-11 16:30:56] We understand, and we actually had a good year last year since thats the first time we were positive.  But this incident wiped it off all away and will be spending more in recovery.  Also, the directors are there just for name as a favor and add credibility which by the way is now in shambles, but they dont really contribute, otherwise they would have sent their army of IT to help us recover.  I am looking at 10-20K to comeback to the heads and this will be coming from our own personal funds.  While there will be some issues on publishing this, as we mentioned, we have already notified the clients and regulators about this breach.

[2025-02-11 16:32:44] by the way, you downloaded your backup files, which will help you as well.

https://prnt.sc/kEciWwBnOoqB

[2025-02-12 07:07:45] part of your files

[2025-02-12 07:07:57] When the timer expires, the decryptor will be deleted and your data will be published

[2025-02-12 07:18:16] Big brother, are you sure there is no problem with your offer?

[2025-02-12 07:25:36] i am sure

[1] The client doesn't have a lot of data

[2025-02-12 07:34:52] I see the company documents

[2025-02-12 07:40:47] The actual data of the customer is less than 8G, and it is a small company, you have such a high price, do you think the customer can afford it?

[2025-02-12 08:30:58] Good day Lockbit, we have met and we have come up with our final offer of 30k.  Please do consider that we are only asking for the deletion of the data as we have already notified the regulators and clients about the breach as mandated by law.  So this is just to minimize exposure so we can concentrate in the restoration activities.  Hoping for you kind consideration.

[2025-02-12 08:36:14] I sat in this company for a week, studied everything, downloaded a lot of documents. I know what I did. Price 3 BTC

[2025-02-12 08:58:37] you know, if we publish your data, you will lose more than 30k

[2025-02-12 09:00:09] they will also end up with your competitors, and you will be on the verge of closing down

[2025-02-13 02:23:54] hello  how much decryptï¼

[2025-02-13 04:31:23] and what is your lower  priceï¼

[2025-02-13 06:35:36] hi, I sent a request test decrypt to tech support, you need to wait. He is not online now

[2025-02-13 06:35:54] price 30k$ in bitcoin

[2025-02-13 06:39:30] hi, 30k$ in bitcoin

[2025-02-13 06:42:01] what files are you talking about, they are fully encrypted and not corrupted, after payment you will get all your files back

[1] i meanï¼To be honest, there are some virtual machine files that, while being encrypted, stopped being encrypted, some of them were intact, some of them were partially encrypted, we fixed some of them, but some of them couldn't be found

[2025-02-13 06:48:11] We are still measuring the loss of the lost virtual machines, because we did fix some of them, because the encryption was not complete, resulting in encryption failures, some encrypted 1 percent, some encrypted 50 percent, some encrypted 90 percent, some encrypted 100 percent

[2025-02-13 07:05:01] hello brotherï¼ can we talk about  the priceï¼

[2025-02-13 07:06:29] As I said, we lost a lot of files, and the encryption mess, resulting in a lot of file corruption, too expensive price, we can not accept, brother

[NULL] I don't understand what you're talking about, the crypt worked in normal mode for full encryption, it's a long process

[2025-02-13 07:11:44] the fact that you are messing with files and you can corrupted  them yourself

[2025-02-13 07:12:57] where there are extensions on files, they will all be decrypted

[2025-02-13 07:14:59] First of all, we did not make any changes to the original file, the second question is that the encryption process is not complete, when the encryption program encrypts the file, encrypts part of it, does not complete the encryption, this can also be decrypted?

[2025-02-13 07:16:40] Because our technical staff did find that the underlying code of some WMDK virtual machine files was 100% rewritten, that is, completely encrypted, but some Wmdk encrypted suffixes are very long, and normal, we detected his underlying code information, and indeed did not complete the encryption, those who did not complete the encryption, only destroyed part. Can you decrypt something like this?

[2025-02-13 07:16:50] There were two modes, encryption by spots and then full encryption.

[2025-02-13 07:17:54] As you said before, because it should be the encryption process, our disk disconnected, resulting in encryption problems, this is the key reason, some files can remove the suffix

[2025-02-13 07:19:09] you have the crypt log in tmp in the esxi.

[] NULL

[1] but you'd better ask yesterday our boss

[2025-02-13 07:23:39] We are very aware of our current situation, the files are encrypted in a mess, some can be decrypted, some can not, encrypted files with problems, his suffix is a dozen bits, the normal should be 8 bits of code,

[] NULL

[2025-02-13 07:24:38] but I'll say again where there's an extension, you get them back.

[2025-02-13 07:25:00]   We want to spend less money, and if we fail, we lose a little less,

[] NULL

[2025-02-13 07:27:34] and the fact that encrypted in a mess is how crypt can work

[2025-02-13 07:28:19] bro, the disks turned off, the crypt simply skipped them because they were not there and continued to suggest making VMs that are available

[2025-02-13 07:28:49] Can you decrypt only a few computers for us?

[1] I'll say it again

[1] it's gonna take a long time

[2025-02-13 07:30:15] Brother, we have also hired professional technicians to check the encryption situation, as I said, there was a serious accident in the encryption process, resulting in WM loss, or WM encryption failure, some of which we have repaired through technical means, or recovered the files inside, and now want to decrypt, those encrypted correctly, can not be repaired,

[1] Let's get to the point

[2025-02-13 07:33:40] disks unmounted, there are still vm untouched, but netapp it encrypted in normal mode, and where there is an extension you will get the files back

[NULL] You don't have to pay me

[2025-02-13 07:36:09] yesterday you ask  me     --- how much you want ?

[] NULL

[2025-02-13 07:37:11] our boss want  Spend lessï¼ and  5000ï¼

[2025-02-13 07:37:53] this is not possible, sort it out without us

[2025-02-13 07:38:13] not interesting at all

[2025-02-13 07:38:18] I know you also want some money, not to embarrass us, our purpose is very simple, minimize the loss,

[2025-02-13 07:39:32] Am I wrong?  it is right

[] 2025-02-13 07:40:25

[NULL] I'm saying 20k

[] NULL

[2025-02-13 07:43:32] I offered you the lowest price for you, anything lower would be an insult to me.

[2025-02-13 07:49:26] we can end this talk, test decrypt and price provided, write to me only if you can pay

[2025-02-13 07:50:40] i need talk with my bossï¼ bro


[2025-02-13 07:52:04] the price is really not high

[2025-02-13 07:52:45] How soon can I get the decryptor after payment

[2025-02-13 07:53:49] you pay extra money to a professional technicians

[] 2025-02-13 07:54:59

[1] We just fixed some virtual machines at a fraction of the cost, and that's the truth

[but there are some virtual machine underlying sectors are 100% encrypted] Brother, I'll be honest

[2025-02-13 07:56:54] you have a lot of files and not only vmdk, they will not decrypt everything for you

[0] yesï¼you are  rightï¼That's why I came to contact you

[2025-02-13 07:58:20] well, it happens, they pay for a small fraction of the critical machines.

[2025-02-13 07:59:21] the decrypt will be available for vmdk and also other files for full decryption

[2025-02-13 07:59:44] so i want ask you   can you  only decypt  we need  wmsï¼ As long as you can make it cheaper


[] 2025-02-13 08:00:31

[2025-02-13 08:02:54] bro i made the lowest price

[] 2025-02-13 08:06:01

[] 2025-02-13 08:08:23

[2025-02-13 08:10:01] i need talk  my boss ï¼

[2025-02-13 08:42:04] hello. my boss, want ask you how about  10K, if  ok   we can pay you 

[2025-02-13 08:57:56] impossible

[2025-02-13 09:14:39] 

[2025-02-13 09:19:03] In view of the current reality, we really can not spend so much money, so I would like to ask you to make it cheaper.

[] 2025-02-13 09:20:08

[2025-02-13 09:32:38] well the boss write that 10k is impossible, here everything, is already the price 20k will remain unchanged

[2025-02-13 09:35:20] Brother, you also know that our case is very special, we did recover some virtual machines ourselves, the situation is relatively bad, those encryption error encryption process stopped at 50%, or 90% did not complete encryption, those can not be decrypted, only complete encryption can be decrypted correctly. You can ask your boss these questions,

[] NULL

[2025-02-13 09:38:10] ok, wait for his answer

[2025-02-13 09:38:25] our boss  told me ï¼if you can argee   ï¼ We will prepare the money for you

We have finally acquired the funds and is now in the process of buying bitcoin.

We'll give you our wallet address once we start purchasing so you could monitor then we'll do an initial test transfer to you after.

We could send you a picture for proof of our activities with your required instructions if needed. Thank you for understanding.

[2025-03-02 14:47:51] You really misunderstood. We are truly not a big company and cannot afford a huge ransom.
But we hope to negotiate a lower ransom so that we can afford it, and you can still receive the payment.
If we truly cannot afford it, you wonât receive any ransom either. Thatâs why Iâm doing my best to help you get an amount we can manage to pay.
If we really go out of business, you wonât receive any ransom either. We donât want this to become a lose-lose situation. Would you agree?

[2025-03-02 14:50:19] some pay, some don't. We won't be upset

[2025-03-02 14:53:00] you offer few, we got upset

[2025-03-02 15:26:51] I will give them to charity

[2025-03-02 15:42:15] You have a great sense of humor, and you are such a good guy. I think we will solve this problem.
Would you please tell you boss thinking about discount.
Do you know 50k bitcoin =  141,234,550,000 NTD ?



[2025-03-02 15:49:24] Yes, I know the price, you are not the first company from Tw and not the only one for me

[2025-03-02 15:50:12] but you pay, we like it

[2025-03-02 15:51:17] but we do more work with cn, they have more money

We are doing our best to collect the money, but 30k is still impossible for us. We can only afford 10K USD.
I understand that you need money too, so I hope we can make a deal that works for both of us.

[2025-03-08 09:41:20] I have prepared the test files and will proceed with testing.
Just to confirm: Should I copy the files to a specific folder before running the decryptor, or will it automatically detect them?

[2025-03-09 21:04:37] automatically

[2025-03-09 23:29:19] Thank you for your help. I noticed something unusual: Some of the encrypted files have two different extensions.
Does the decryptor automatically detect both extensions and decrypt them properly?

[2025-03-12 13:20:53] Earlier, you mentioned that the tech support will do test, but now you said only the boss has access to the decryptor. Could you clarify why this changed?
Is there a reason why the tech team cannot handle the test decryption as originally stated?

[2025-03-12 13:23:33] We are still willing to proceed with the payment for the full decryption, but we need to resolve the test issue first.
Is there any alternative solution to confirm the decryption process?

[2025-03-13 10:13:05] Hello

[NULL] sorry, never happened before but the boss is still not online,i don't know

[2025-03-13 10:56:39] Has there ever been a backup solution in situations like this?

[2025-03-13 13:36:17] only the boss has a decryptor, without him no one will have any deals.

[2025-03-13 13:39:20] he will come and explain why this happened, just have to wait, without it we lose money

[] 2025-03-13 13:41:20

[1] but don't worry

[2025-03-13 14:51:56] I see, so without the boss, what happens to your role?
Are you also affected by this situation?

[2025-03-13 15:03:51] Lockbit is an affiliate program that provides us with a tool for work, in darknet there are other options with an affiliate program

[2025-03-13 15:08:18] we've been working with him for 5 years and we've never had a situation like this, he's always been online. Let's wait and hope that everything is fine

[] 2025-03-13 15:09:39

[1] I'm not worried about your money

[2025-03-13 15:21:33]  I understand that this is a difficult situation for everyone, especially since the boss has never gone offline like this before.
You must be under a lot of pressure handling so many people waiting for answers.

[2025-03-14 08:43:24] 

[2025-03-14 08:47:56] We have many readme files, and there seems to have 2 or more ID, the decryptor can deal all of them ?

[2025-03-14 08:50:12] Our encrypted files have two types of file extensions: 9K0wghrzi and 75f9ad51.
Can the decryptor decrypt all of them?

[2025-03-14 11:43:36] yes there will be 2 decryptors for esxi and win

[2025-03-14 13:11:56] Thank you for providing the file. We are currently verifying.
I will update you once we have completed our validation.

[2025-03-14 13:21:23] ok

[2025-03-14 13:22:09] You must have had a really busy day today!

[2025-03-14 13:44:35] Thanks, I appreciate your support. Just to plan accordingly, how soon after payment will we receive the full decryptor?
We need to ensure we have everything ready on our side for a smooth process.

[1] boss is back and he's online

[2025-03-14 15:03:54] Hi there.  I got a question here wish you would answer truthfully


[2025-03-14 15:11:10] You mentioned 0.25 coins for 'all network' before.  In fact, we have 3 branch sites taken down, with multiple networks, in one shot.

I would like to know if this 'all network' includes all 3 sites and their local networks? 
Or the 0.25 btc ransom will only decrypt networks with this chatroom ID, that I will have to pay another 0.25 or even more for other branch offices?


[2025-03-14 15:36:24] 0.25 BTC all network and all branch

[2025-03-14 15:39:05] We will give you a decryption tool it is one for all ID

[] NULL

[2025-03-14 16:28:19] we can give you discount 10%

[2025-03-15 02:35:25] Before proceeding, we need to finalize the payment details.
Can you confirm the total amount required for the full decryptor, including any necessary fees?

[2025-03-15 03:01:34] yes 30k in bitcoin

[2025-03-15 03:01:48] hey there

[2025-03-15 03:07:24] hi

[2025-03-15 03:09:21] we need to recovery our files

[] NULL

[2025-03-15 03:44:15] ok discount, 35k

[] NULL

[2025-03-15 03:51:48] 
Once payment is sent, how do we confirm that it has been received on your side?
Do we need to wait for blockchain confirmations, or will you acknowledge it immediately?

[2025-03-15 04:25:42] you had time to find money, as i said 35k

[2025-03-15 04:28:30] the company Revenue cant cover that


[2025-03-15 04:31:54] then you will not decrypt the files

[2025-03-15 04:32:49] yes, I will confirm the receipt immediately

[2025-03-15 04:34:49] cmon why you didn't publish your files? I guess you don't have them?

[2025-03-15 04:36:22] our files*

[2025-03-15 11:42:20] btw, any chance of getting a one-time, unique chatroom link + ID for this chat? the readme.txt was exposed to a 3rd party and I  clearly know someone else is logging on and off this chatroom occasionally.


[2025-03-15 11:45:13] the pdf.7z you sent before should not be given by another company. but they had the readme before so they do have the chat accesskey and ID


[2025-03-15 11:46:29] This is a secret chat that only you can see. A third party also comes in but they have a different chat. This chat is only available to you.

[2025-03-15 11:49:27] yea i know that.  but in fact only intervened this chat yesterday.  the "test please" and "how much" part wasnt replied by me. I guess you can tell by the difference in communication style.   Someone got into this chat before us and tried to sell us the decryptor lol


[2025-03-15 11:50:37] we had trouble in finding methods of paying btc so we did not reply anything but just watched the chat.
Then my team asked me to inquire about the 3 branch and network things  etc. 

[] NULL

[2025-03-15 11:54:49] In this chat no one sees these messages except me and you. I can make another separate chat if you want, but I will delete all chats after payment.

[2025-03-15 11:57:31] just letting you know that someone else used the same TOR link, same Key and same ID to communicate with you first. It was not me. They showed the decrypted pds file to us right after you sent it in the chat.

[2025-03-29 03:40:48] Thank you for your update. Unfortunately, the offered price is still way beyond our budget. We are currently facing severe financial difficulties, potentially approaching bankruptcy.

Though I got so much pressure from my boss to get the files back, but we simply do not have the funds to meet the current decryption price. While our team is working on transcribing printed backups into digital format, the encrypted files remain extremely valuable to us.

I would truly appreciate any further flexibility you can offer on the pricing.

[2025-03-30 23:26:50] I really need to get the files back, but your request is far beyond what the company are able to pay. As I told you, the company is on the edge of bankruptcy, and I have not been paid in over two months. I only make $300 a month, and if I could, I would spend my own money to help get a resolution. I am therefore asking for your understanding. Can you speak to your boss and possibly offer something more reasonable given our situation?

[2025-04-01 13:42:31] i just received all my files


[2025-04-01 14:21:14] how is your meeting?

[2025-04-01 14:55:18] You can attach a few files for test decryption by packing them into an archive with zip, rar, tar, 7zip, 7z, tar.gz extensions of no more than 10 megabytes using the attach button directly in the chat.

If your archive weighs more than 10 megabytes, please use our file sharing service.

[2025-04-01 14:58:50] What are the next steps to unencrypt our data?

[2025-04-01 17:09:28] Hello. Please wait, we will answer you soon

[just send them to us
- As a proof of data possession we can provide a partial file-tree of downloaded data (usually about 5-7% of total volume] we will try to convey information about the leak of your data to each of these contacts.

We offer you to make a deal and resolve this issue smoothly

[2025-04-01 17:40:36] $400,00 is unaffordable, as we are a small independently owned business.  Due to post covid business challenges, the most that is affordable is $5000, for a full recovery.  Otherwise, I may be looking at bankruptcy.  Please accept this offer. 

[2025-04-01 19:21:00] This is absolutely unacceptable. Sometimes we give some discounts in case of loyal cooperation and fast negotiations. But this is definitely not a 90%+ discount. In your case, we have nothing more to offer you.

[2025-04-01 20:47:13] I have reached out to family members for money help, but we are not a cash rich people.  The most I can raise is $20,000. total.  Can you please accept this offer?!

[2025-04-01 21:43:34] What family members? What are you talking about? We know all the necessary information about your company. And the money we asked you for is not very large for your company. If you, the one who contacted you, are an ordinary employee, then we should not continue the conversation, you need to urgently contact the management.
To answer your question: your offer is not even close to the real values. The price we asked for is not a joke. This is an absolutely real offer.

Please contact us when you are ready for real negotiations, and not this kindergarten.

[2025-04-01 23:32:49] We cannot afford that much. Can you please work with us on price?

[2025-04-02 00:55:32] å¦ä½ä¿è¯ï¼


[2025-04-02 03:18:56] Hello, can the data sent to you be decrypted?

[2025-04-02 03:39:08] We are the number 1 team in the world! We are waiting for your payment today

[2025-04-02 04:19:52] Have you given up?

[2025-04-02 04:22:33] 2025-04-20 will follow up.

[2025-04-02 06:50:23] The boss is very busy and often responds to messages for 3-5 days. You can use the original file.
I consulted the team and we deployed multiple encryption programs in this client that caused the inability to recover by 1 decryption. The boss is being resolved.
Always believe that what our team promises will definitely do, after receiving the ransom.

The  ransome ist more than 20 times the amount which we had to pay for the work needed to reestablish our hardware functional an reload data.
So we can only offer a ransom of max USD 3k because in this case we would be operational quicker.

[2025-04-11 20:01:31] Hello,
I am writing to you from Iran. Please believe me when I say I am not a wealthy person or part of any rich organization. I donât have access to international banking systems, and because of global sanctions, I canât even buy Bitcoin legally in my country.
The amount youâre asking is far beyond anything I could ever afford. Our currency has lost almost all its value â people here are struggling just to survive. Paying 5 BTC per server is not just difficult, itâs completely impossible for me. Even saving 0.1 BTC would take years here.
This situation has destroyed everything Iâve worked for. I am desperate and broken. Please understand that Iâm not your enemy â Iâm just a small person in a very hard place, trying to find a way forward.
If there is any way you could help, or reduce the amount, or show any mercy, I would be deeply grateful. I am willing to cooperate or discuss any possible solution that is humanly possible for me.
Thank you for reading. I truly hope you will show some mercy.

[2025-04-11 21:06:11] I understand but we cannot get that much together for this. Can you come down further?

[2025-04-11 21:08:27] We have selected files for testing:

[2025-04-11 21:43:17] we can pay maximum 0.5 BTC. is that possible for you? 

[2025-04-12 02:40:38] You are wasting our time. One who wants to pay, solve this issue and not ask these kind of questions.

[2025-04-12 04:07:13] ????????

[2025-04-12 04:23:25] Why don't you delay reading the news? Don't reply to messages?

[2025-04-12 06:36:31] Euer Versuch, mich durch erbÃ¤rmliche VerschlÃ¼sselungstricks und leere Drohungen zum Zahlen zu zwingen, ist gescheitert. Eure Ransomware mag Dateien blockieren, doch Angst verbreitet ihr nicht. WÃ¤hrend ihr euch hinter Affiliate-Programmen und anonymen Serverfarmen versteckt, haben internationale BehÃ¶rden eure Infrastruktur bereits zerschlagen â die Kontrolle Ã¼ber eure Erpresser-Webseiten ist lÃ¤ngst verloren.

Ihr behauptet, unbesiegbar zu sein, doch selbst euer angeblicher Â«SprecherÂ» Dmitrij Choroschew steht nun mit einem 10-Millionen-Dollar-Kopfgeld auf der Liste des FBI. Sanktionen machen jede Zahlung an euch zur Straftat, und Ã¼ber 2500 EntschlÃ¼sselungsschlÃ¼ssel liegen bereits in den HÃ¤nden der Ermittler. Eure Â«Doppel-ErpressungÂ»? Ein lahmes ManÃ¶ver, das lÃ¤ngst durchschaut ist.

Statt LÃ¶segeld zu kassieren, werdet ihr bald selbst zahlen â mit eurer Freiheit. Jeder Angriff hinterlÃ¤sst Spuren, und jedes Opfer, das sich weigert, schwÃ¤cht eure Macht. Ihr seid keine digitalen DÃ¤monen, nur eine Bande von Dieben, die auf die Verzweiflung anderer angewiesen ist. Meine Daten mÃ¶gen verschlÃ¼sselt sein, doch meine Entschlossenheit ist es nicht.

Mit verachtungsvoller Gelassenheit,

[1] Whatever the reason is, only you can decrypt the files! Now that it's been so long

[] 2025-04-12 14:55:48

[2025-04-12 14:58:50] There is no backup of key customer data, and the problem can only be solved by decryption, and the encrypted data is also your suffix, and there is no problem of damage to the data we check through WinHEX!

[2025-04-12 15:11:56] The 100GB data I gave me last time is not useful to the customer at all, do you have any other data from the customer?

[2025-04-12 15:48:00] Offer or publication?

[2025-04-12 18:13:05] We will download the File Samples. Its late into the weekend and the team will not be together again until next week to review what you have provided.

[2025-04-12 22:54:27] Price 7k$

[2025-04-13 06:09:51] Hello,

We have reviewed your request of 4 BTC, but unfortunately this is completely unrealistic for us.

We are a small company based in Turkey, and due to the current economic situation, including extreme inflation and currency devaluation, we are struggling to even cover basic operational costs. 4 BTC is equivalent to more than what our company earns in months, and it is simply not possible for us to gather such an amount.

After speaking with management and evaluating all our options, the absolute maximum we could possibly arrange is 1 BTC. Even this would require extraordinary effort and personal sacrifices from our team.

Please consider our situation. We are not a large or wealthy organization, and we are trying to recover and continue supporting our employees and customers. We hope you will be reasonable and work with us towards a solution.

Looking forward to your response.

[2025-04-13 17:09:53] can you also let us know how did you entered the network , very important for us thank you


[2025-04-13 17:12:53] It's your encryption problem! Don't put the blame on the customer! You have to give me a time to solve the problem, or how will I explain it to the customer?

[2025-04-13 17:25:39] I will explain you this one last time. The files that were not subjected to modification during the encryption process by your security software were decrypted by you without any problems. The files that were damaged by your flawed security software during the encryption process are the ones that are now corrupted. Contact the company that provides you with security software to solve this problem. As soon as they make the files the way they should be after encryption, you will be able to decrypt them using the decryptor that you already have.

[1] If you can solve it, you can solve it, and if you can't solve it

[2025-04-13 17:43:47] Can't you solve it? If it doesn't work, let us know!

[2025-04-14 03:54:08] 

[2025-04-14 05:00:38] Hello, we are the sole intermediary designated by the client. Could you kindly decrypt it? May I ask the client

[2025-04-14 05:09:41] how much?


[2025-04-14 05:29:13] I want to be completely honest with you: I donât have access to any international banking systems. I donât have a foreign account, and I canât legally buy cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in my country. I live in Iran, and we are under heavy sanctions. Our currency â the Toman â has lost almost all its value. Even earning just a small amount of BTC is a nearly impossible task here.

Iâm not a business owner with income in dollars or euros. Iâm just an individual who has lost everything â 20 servers gone. What youâre asking for is simply beyond my means, even with a discount. If there was a way to pay in Toman, I could try to gather something, but I know it may not be useful to you.

Please, I am desperate. Iâm not trying to avoid responsibility â I just need a chance to recover even part of what Iâve lost. If you can reduce the amount to something that someone like me could possibly afford, I will do everything I can to make it happen.

This is my last hope. Iâm asking not as a company or target â just as a human being.

[2025-04-14 15:31:15] We set this price because we know the client is able to pay. This is a low price for this company.

We are honest and we can ensure decryption after receiving the ransom.
If the ransom is too low, we will not decrypt it.

[2025-04-19 11:53:55] Hi


[2025-04-19 13:10:45] is there a program run in windows x86?


[] 2025-04-19 13:36:12

[2025-04-19 13:40:38] 

[2025-04-19 13:41:42] here is the decrpt.llg  which I run in Ubuntu. please tell me how to solve it.  Is the decrypt program right?

[2025-04-19 13:43:17] how much ?

[2025-04-19 13:55:23] ./decrypt_ESXI_X64 -i /home/user/folder

[2025-04-19 13:56:43] Put the files for decryption into the folder, you do not need to specify any parameters in ESXI, it will find all the files and decrypt them

[2025-04-19 14:02:24] ./decrypt_ESXI_X64 -i /home/user/folder   can't work in Ubuntu. no any response.  All 3 test files can't be decrypted.
should I have to run in ESXI ?

[2025-04-19 14:05:38] descriptor for ESXI, start it

[2025-04-19 14:07:47] I will reinstall a new ESXI and run this program on it. I hope you can send a program run in WINDOWS

[2025-04-21 03:45:17] we have 2 esxi,this  is other  esxi, but this ID  only 2VMDK  need


[2025-04-21 03:49:18] Their different ids

[2025-04-21 04:04:02] ok wait pls

[2025-04-21 04:07:03] Our company is still discussing the decision on whether to make the payment, because this is not a small sum of money. We have some independent backups. In veeam, it is rather troublesome to restore them

[2025-04-21 04:20:04] in ?

[2025-04-21 04:20:26] ?????????

[1] it's up to you to pay or not

[] NULL

[2025-04-21 06:18:49] How much are you willing to pay given the initial amount?

[2025-04-21 06:31:39] All files that were not damaged during the encryption process by your security system were decrypted using the decryption software that we previously provided to you. The rest of the files were 100% corrupted, and they cannot be decrypted without the help of the providers of the security software that you use.

[2025-04-21 06:42:10] You can encrypt why can't you decrypt it? If we can't decrypt the customer asking us for a refund, what should we do?

[2025-04-21 06:43:34] I think you can handle it, it's just that you don't want to deal with it!

[2025-04-21 06:45:08] If it is an ordinary file that cannot be decrypted, it is still acceptable to the customer. But the database files cannot be decrypted, and for the customer, these are worthless!

[2025-04-21 09:53:21] 

[2025-04-21 10:25:25] Yes.

[2025-04-21 10:30:53] Decryptor will delete at - 2025-05-05 19:59:23

[2025-04-21 10:31:10] Since you have no contact for a long time, the ransom price will increase. You need to pay 42,000 USDT. All data can be decrypted.

[2025-04-21 10:32:25] You must contact us before 2025-05-01 00:00:00 UTC. Because applying to the boss also takes time.

[2025-04-21 10:40:32] If there are very few documents that can still be said in the past, the key is that there are more than 50,000 documents, so how to deal with it?

[2025-04-21 12:55:47] we need the decryption cost urgently

[2025-04-21 12:57:59] 30% discount, will that suit you?

[2025-04-21 13:11:54] ?

[2025-04-21 13:19:09] I have many questions to consult you. We have many file encryption suffixes that are different. It seems that the encryption process was terminated, resulting in file damage.

[2025-04-21 13:40:38] i need decryptor


[2025-04-21 13:44:14] we already made 2 test decrypt in other chats

[2025-04-21 13:47:07] wait pls

[2025-04-21 13:47:33] Many file extensions are incorrect. They should have stopped during the encryption process. No complete encryption has been formed

[2025-04-21 13:48:37] Please show these pictures to your technician

[2025-04-21 13:54:09] ok

[2025-04-21 14:29:37] Please consult your technicians. When the encryption process of a file stops and the encryption is not fully completed, can your decryptor decrypt it  ï¼thx

[2025-04-21 14:50:28] We discovered the vmdk of more virtual machines
All the documents have such problems. During the encryption period, stop the process of encrypting the file
So it will cause his file suffixes to be chaotic, with a lot of garbled characters |

[2025-04-21 15:07:19] The current issue is not how much we pay, but that too many files were damaged during the encryption process, and the encryption process was stopped, resulting in the files not being encrypted completely? 

[2025-04-21 15:07:37] Please send us the locklog file. And also a list of all files on ESXI

[2025-04-23 04:51:01] Hello , wait test. We can talk about discount if you pay fast

[2025-04-23 04:56:04] Hello, I have a question to consult you. Our virtual machine has many different suffixes, and their lengths and characters are all different. However, the first few characters are the same, while the latter ones are either very poor or very short. May I ask whether to use one KEY for decryption in this situation, or if different suffixes require different keys? Sorry, I have to make a report for my boss to see. Only then will the boss decide how to handle it

[2025-04-23 05:01:11] you will have one decryptor for all esxi system, also one build was used for encryption

[2025-04-23 05:02:20] after payment, you will immediately receive a decryptor and will be able to return all virtual machines on the same day

[2025-04-23 05:04:14] we also stay in the chat in case of questions

[2025-04-23 05:09:52] In this situation, we need to first encrypt the files that were not encrypted before? And then decrypt?

[2025-04-23 05:10:16] noo

[2025-04-23 05:11:03] you will only need to run the decryptor

[2025-04-23 05:11:15] I know that those VMDK files were not encrypted completely and were terminated during the encryption process

[2025-04-23 05:17:35] i nee make a report to my boss

[2025-04-23 12:10:54] hello


[2025-04-23 12:17:13] The file you sent me, although the suffix has been removed, is still damaged

[2025-04-23 12:20:54] i ready check it  ï¼bro

[1] You can have your technicians detect it. It's exactly the same as before decryption

[2025-04-23 12:35:07] yeah well we discussed it with the companies and just very few want to pay, if we put the money together what they individually are ready to pay we are at about 200.000 USD. Are there any possible other ways? 

[2025-04-23 12:39:35] Are you sure you want to lose your reputation? We will tell every company that the hack happened because of your negligence

[2025-04-23 12:40:16] we are a small hosting company, it is now in our decision to pay this, you must know this 

[2025-04-23 12:42:34] What do you think will happen to your company if we publish all the data on each company?

[2025-04-23 12:43:07] how do you think we could pay 2 million USD when we are just a small company? we could not even if we would like to 

[2025-04-23 12:43:38] This is very bad.

[] NULL

[] NULL

[2025-04-23 12:45:32] Explain what will happen if their data is published.

[] 2025-04-23 12:49:32

[] NULL

[] NULL

[2025-04-23 13:02:15] yeah the small companies need the decryptor and thats what they would pay the 200.000 USD for


[] NULL

[2025-04-23 13:03:03] Because either everyone or no one will get the decryptor

[2025-04-23 13:25:40] Hello? Can I take a look at the test file?

[2025-04-23 13:27:29] Please wait, a technician will answer you

[2025-04-23 13:34:49] 

[2025-04-23 13:36:28] More than 90 percent of the files have this situation, and only a small amount of encryption is normal

[] NULL

[2025-04-23 13:39:50] Just as my partner described, for 90% of virtual machine files, the first few digits of their suffixes are normal, but there are some strange characters at the end. Of course, there will be a small number of normally encrypted virtual machines, and that is a very small quantity.

[2025-04-23 13:48:32] you can run your vmdk after decryption ?

[2025-04-23 13:49:37] noï¼The link you just sent me has been downloaded by me. It is no different from the previously encrypted and damaged file, except that there is no suffix

[2025-04-23 13:51:03] interesting, we are waiting for a response from the technician

[2025-04-23 13:51:27] is still damaged

[2025-04-23 13:52:53] Did you see the compressed package I just sent you? It contains some virtual machines that I randomly inspected, and they all have such problems

[] 2025-04-23 13:56:37

[1] If the technician doesn't solve the situation

[2025-04-23 14:05:12] But we still have several others that we want to decrypt. Could they be cheaper

[2025-04-23 14:08:35] Including a NAS, which can be accessed through the windows system, but the office files inside have been encrypted by you

[2025-04-23 14:09:36] We just want to try our best to recover the losses

[NULL] bro no it won't be cheaper

[2025-04-23 14:14:22] Just as we said before, some of us are normal, bro. You encrypted our data, which prevented us from working normally. But we still want to recover some losses. We are sincere

[2025-04-23 14:16:02] Since we have several ESXI machines, one of them seems normal, but the number of virtual machines on that one is not large. Moreover, we have a NAS with a lot of office documents that we want to decrypt. Considering the current situation, I would like to communicate sincerely with you. You take the money, and we will try to minimize the loss of some data. Is that okay

[] 2025-04-23 14:20:00

[2025-04-23 14:21:11] I understand the situation is difficult for you

[2025-04-23 14:22:17] yes ï¼my friend 

[2025-04-23 14:23:19] Hello. Yes wait . Tomorrow

[NULL] If I don't try my best to recover the losses

[] 2025-04-23 14:25:24

[2025-04-23 14:27:24] From the very beginning, I sincerely wanted to cooperate with you. However, at present, our problem is very bad. Even though you have a lot of money and may look down upon our case, please help us. Thank you. We will keep all your affairs confidential. We just want to recover some losses

[] 2025-04-23 14:29:45

[2025-04-23 14:57:35] we have a reputation, we have been working for more than 6 years and after pay the decryptor we have not had any problems with their decryption

[2025-04-23 14:58:22] we are not a scam, we work honestly

[2025-04-23 15:01:47] Brother, I have known some of you before. Through the Internet, you are very honest and have a good reputation.

[] 2025-04-23 15:03:40

[2025-04-23 15:04:41] Our boss has arranged for me to minimize the losses as much as possible. If the decryption cannot be done correctly, we will either replenish the data or create a new virtual machine. However, for those with normal suffixes, we want to decrypt them.

[] 2025-04-23 15:05:43

[] NULL

[] NULL

[2025-04-23 15:11:17] We have three esxi systems. Two of them have garbled file suffixes. The samples have also been sent to you. Indeed, their decryption cannot proceed normally. However, there is still one esxi whose suffix is normal. We want to decrypt it. If the price is too high, our boss will ask me to leave. So I would like to request you to reset a reasonable price. Regarding our current special circumstances,

[2025-04-23 15:15:47] Brother, please reply to me as soon as possible. I hope we can reach an agreement today, solve this matter, forget those bad things. You take the money and we can recover some losses

[] NULL

[2025-04-23 15:29:35] Our team has met and we find that our policy does not expressly make funds available for a payment when there are existing riders to get us up and running. Your demand does not allow for that. 

[2025-04-23 15:39:05] Your answer is unclear. We need a straight explanation: what exactly is stopping the payment? If there are specific conditions, name them â or let me ask another way: should we start publishing your data?

[2025-04-23 15:55:45] helloï¼ ?

[2025-04-23 16:15:10] My boss is going to fire me. I want to reach an agreement with you as soon as possible and solve some problems. Is that okay?

[2025-04-23 17:21:46] or how much would be just the decryptor?

[2025-04-24 02:50:06] 

[2025-04-24 02:51:20] However, I sent you a VMDK earlier. The file you sent back is still unusable and damaged,Our technicians compared the underlying hex code of the file. The file you sent back and decrypted is exactly the same as the original one, except that the suffix has been removed

[2025-04-24 02:53:24] Please check the attachment I just uploaded

[2025-04-24 02:55:15] We also found some issues. For some small files, their extensions are incorrect, but when I was asked to remove the file extension, it was not encrypted. However, for the large file VMDK, its extension is abnormal, and removing the file extension is bad. I sent one of them to you, but after you decrypted it, it was still the same as before and could not be used

[2025-04-24 02:58:15] Can you give me a cheap price?

There are three situations where the suffix is incorrect. 1: The file itself is not encrypted. We can directly delete the suffix and the file can be used, or change it to the correct suffix and decrypt it without affecting its use. 2: When the encryption of a file is correct, we need to change its abnormal suffix to a normal one to decrypt it correctly. After the file is decrypted, it is normal. 3: If the file encryption process stops and the file is damaged, and we change it to a normal suffix,
 it will not be decrypted either, because the file itself is not fully encrypted and its encrypted information is incomplete, so it will not be decrypted

[2025-04-25 01:29:42] Most of our data is still damaged. Of course, this is just an objective response. The real situation is that a small amount of VMDK has been decrypted. Just as I said before, I'm not lying. I'm just giving you suggestions to update your encryption.

[2025-04-26 11:10:03] 
There are three situations where the suffix is incorrect. 1: The file itself is not encrypted. We can directly delete the suffix and the file can be used, or change it to the correct suffix and decrypt it without affecting its use. 2: When the encryption of a file is correct, we need to change its abnormal suffix to a normal one to decrypt it correctly. After the file is decrypted, it is normal. 3: If the file encryption process stops and the file is damaged, and we change it to a normal suffix,
it will not be decrypted either, because the file itself is not fully encrypted and its encrypted information is incomplete, so it will not be decrypted 

[2025-04-26 11:13:03] Brother, I have obtained the encryption of the Windows system. Could y--- this

[2025-04-26 11:13:58]

[2025-04-26 13:12:30]  Brother, I have obtained the encryption of the Windows system. Could you permanently close this chat window? Because there is too much information about the company in it.

[2025-04-27 14:49:10] As I informed you, we are a non-profit school, it is very difficult to make a profit, we have no funds.

[2025-04-27 14:55:21]  25 gigas

[2025-04-27 15:14:13] That policy does not expressly make funds available for ransom payment. There are other considerations that are expressed in the policy like restoration & remediation support to assist with us becoming operational and liability issues. We do not want you to publish data either. Our team will be meeting mid-week to fully assess our options.

[2025-04-27 16:17:43] There is a person who was fired from school, she was not an honest person, with her password she deleted several things afterwards, because there was a backdoor user, so out of malice I think she passed information to you.


[2025-04-27 16:18:53] the intention was certainly to harm me


[2025-04-27 19:03:16] Could you provide the following files from the file list.

[2025-04-27 22:35:26] hi


[2025-04-28 01:42:35] It takes time to contact the boss, you must contact us before 2025-05-02 00:00:00.

[2025-04-28 02:53:56] Think about the price again

[2025-04-28 05:15:39] http://lockbitfskq2fxclyfrop5yizyxpzu65w7pphsgthawcyb4gd27x62id.onion/r/HmTCwdQakz#G9QLymQtd32Vnr+zSnEgZTl2qS6NWQXgt/FDLk1/E9w=

[1] Dude, the school's maintainers don't receive any profit. If you want, I can prove it to you.

I'm sure that whoever contacted you did so with the intention of directly harming me.

I would just like you to help me and tell me what your minimum is. I understand that you don't negotiate, that you have your own price, but look, we are a school, all our income goes to paying the employees and keeping the school running.

I don't know what to offer

[2025-04-28 09:29:38] Thank you for sharing the details.

We understand that you expect to be compensated for your efforts, and we respect the work youâve done.
However, the amount youâre asking for is extremely difficult for us to manage, especially under the current circumstances.
Is there any way we could work together to find a figure that would be more realistic for us, while still respecting the effort youâve made?
We are trying to find a solution that minimizes losses on both sides.

[2025-04-28 10:21:12] You can attach a few files for test decryption by packing them into an archive with zip, rar, tar, 7zip, 7z, tar.gz extensions of no more than 10 megabytes using the attach button directly in the chat.
