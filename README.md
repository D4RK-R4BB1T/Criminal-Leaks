# UPDATE
Look, I'm going to be honest: I hate regular expressions * gasp * I know I know either way there's gonna be some errors. I've tried my best to correct some of them notably with zooville and BMR (BMR being the smaller of the headaches). You should know if there's an Error BMR specifically was mostly a user bio issues so you might see something to the tune of "CONTACT{USER EMAIL}" or something to the degree it appears to be mostly capitalized where as ZooVille's problem is: Well, the same but has a huge fetish for "2019" there's some emails and no. I am not going to spend my late nights and weekdays trying to fix this god awful thing. It's not much work for you, I've done the bulk majority so please don't complain.

I Had to: 
1. Source the databases / scrape the forums 
2. Parse the data and do SOME cleanup

It's CSV/TXT the JSON shit is not my doing and I have 0 interests in fixing, translating or whatever... that's on you. Alright? I love you but I'm tired.

# UPDATES GOING FORWARD
Look, this isn't the end of the story alright? I get it multiple points of data I've leaked prior or whatever. I have more. Lot's more. Just don't be a pain in my ass and beg please? Thank you.
