# UPDATE
Look, I'm going to be honest: I hate regular expressions * gasp * I know I know either way there's gonna be some errors. I've tried my best to correct some of them notably with zooville and BMR (BMR being the smaller of the headaches). You should know if there's an Error BMR specifically was mostly a user bio issues so you might see something to the tune of "CONTACT{USER EMAIL}" or something to the degree it appears to be mostly capitalized where as ZooVille's problem is: Well, the same but has a huge fetish for "2019" there's some emails and no. I am not going to spend my late nights and weekdays trying to fix this god awful thing. It's not much work for you, I've done the bulk majority so please don't complain.

I Had to: 
1. Source the databases / scrape the forums 
2. Parse the data and do SOME cleanup

It's CSV/TXT the JSON shit is not my doing and I have 0 interests in fixing, translating or whatever... that's on you. Alright? I love you but I'm tired.

### URSNIF, Yanluowang & BlackBasta 
**Background:** URSNIF is a banking trojan which failed to pay it's affiliates and it resulted in a partial leak and doxing of the creators. Yanluowang was thought to be a Chinese based Ransomware group until it had it's chats leaked revealing it as a Russian-Based Ransomware group. BlackBasta is widly known and yet I have absolutely no idea whatever the hell is in this leak and I don't care to read it.

**Leaked Data:** According to various tweets regarding blackbasta? Someone gained access to "Goblin Crypt" a private malware obfuscation service amongst other things. As per the other groups? Personal Information and details surrounding the day to day lives of Ransomware & Malware developers. I haven't taken the time to look through. So your guess is as good as mine.
